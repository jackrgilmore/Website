# Subway Music

The ground shook as a subway car rattled across the tracks of the A Line station, New Delphi. Murphy was jolted awake from his blissful doze. He’d been dreaming of a day in his youth when his father had taken him to NetflixLand. The sun had beat down on both of them as they had gone from store to store, amusement ride to amusement ride. He could almost taste the sickly sweetness of the cotton candy…

…reality was disappointing.

He sat, leaning against the grimy wall of the subway, his guitar in his lap. A beat-up fedora, his own, sat in front of him, splayed suggestively to the passerby. It held a few pennies and nickels. He wore a pair of stained jeans and a sorry-looking bomber jacket, with torn gloves. There was a chain that snaked below the neckline of what had once clearly been a white t-shirt. A gun was holstered at his hip. He blinked groggily and looked around.

The feeling of a subway station is always the same. The rapid battering of feet across artificial stone, echoes of metal on metal, and an inescapable scent of piss and bodies. He lit a cigarette and pondered this, watching as people passed him without a glance. The smoke drifted lazily through the air, following the path of another passing train. As it passed, he squinted, shifting in place slightly. He surreptitiously lifted his arm and bent his head towards it, in a faux attempt to wipe some of the grime from his face.

“…this is a bad idea,” he whispered into the device on his wrist.

*You have a better one?* replied the Voice in his head.

“We could capture her after she leaves the station. Position the rest of the Cadre to jump her in an alley.”

*We have gone over those options. They are too public; our likelihood of success drops below the line of feasibility. This was your plan. Do you doubt your instincts?*

“No. This is our best chance, but… indulge me. Check the odds?”

*The models are stable. 82.4% success rate, barring the direct intervention of a weaver.*

“… somehow, I still have a bad feeling,” Murphy muttered. Another train approached, the sound decelerating ahead of the vehicle. It screeched to a stop, illuminating the platform with the sign on the side of every car: **AMAZON BASICS: AMENITIES FOR ALL**

Amidst a crowd of sweaty, frantic passengers, a young woman stepped out of the train car. She wore the uniform of an Amazon U.S. Service officer. She carried a slim package under her arm. Her head turned towards Murphy’s darkened corner briefly, and he slinked back. Her eyes were dark, glaring. *The eyes of a killer*, Murphy thought. She turned away and began walking at a brisk pace towards the steps leading out into the greater city. 

There was an odd moment of stillness in the subway then — perhaps 2 heartbeats — before Murphy pocketed the coins from his fedora, placed the hat on his head, and followed her.

Ana Skornick was having a bad day. 

She had been sent on a wild goose chase this morning, had lost her lucky sweatshirt, her application to Ecole Ducasse had been denied, and she was currently stepping out into the ugliest subway station she had ever seen. 

The only thing grand about New Delphi Grand Central was the aspirations of the graffiti artists who had tagged the walls. They were clearly aiming for some form of surrealism, but the fluorescent tones of paint had since melted into greenish-brown sludge, only serving to cover the concrete walls in one more layer of human filth. Her sleep-deprived eyes felt heavy as she peered through the grey aura of the tunnel, searching for signage that might lead her to a destination. She saw vague light ahead and walked towards the steps, sluggish.

“Jesus, let this be quick,” she prayed

She had been hired by Amazon U.S. after 2 years of grueling work in the hospitality industry. After graduating from uni, she had applied relentlessly to work in a top 50 restaurant as a dishwasher or waiter, willing to take the slightest chance and work herself to the bone. And she had succeeded… at the latter. 

Working as a dishwasher at Luma for 15 months proved to be a thorough education in disillusionment. The chefs expected perfection even from dishwashing. She went home every day dead on her feet, bones aching, and her hands wrinkled from the sudsy water. So, tired and numb, she quit. No one even noticed her departure. She basked in glorious unemployment for a month before her finances called her back. And, like many other tired, dream-trodden people, she applied for a desk job at A Corp.

It had been an odd request from the counter this morning. An anomaly on any day and a disturbance on this particular one. She had gone into work expecting to sit at a desk, answering the few product referrals and redactions that the AI didn’t somehow manage to filter through. Instead, she had opened her console to the message: **PRIME+: SPECIAL REQUEST**. 

In the years since Amazon Corp. had risen from tech giant to a semi-autonomous global political power, new subscription tiers had emerged. For the most part, they were simply another dissection of global wealth. Average consumers paid monthly for Amazon Standard.  Above that were Copper, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Those who could afford Amazon Platinum were in the top 5% of consumers around the world: billionaires. Above that, there were probably only 6 people alive who could afford Amazon Prime. But… this message… Prime+ was not on the list. And if a new tier had been released, there would have been months of ad campaigns. Not the littlest person under the largest rock would be ignorant.
