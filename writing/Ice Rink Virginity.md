# I lost my virginity to the bench on the side of the quad ice rink

It was a cold January evening. I had just awoken from my 20 minute power nap when I heard vague mumblings from my roommate through the haze of sleep. 
"See you dude" 
"wehefijk... wherer you goin?"
"ice skating"

What good fortune! I had purchased a pair of ice skates at the lovely Dick's sporting goods the semester prior. Until this moment they had been rotting in the corner of my dorm room, unused and unloved. Little did I know that they would be the vehicle of my own thorough use and loving by the Bowdoin ice rink green bench. 

I arrived at the frozen tundra in the middle of the quad shortly after my roommate. There were a bunch of dudes playing hockey on the ice already. I vaguely recognized some of them from walking around campus. I don't know what the hell was in those rum and cokes first semester but I can't remember anyone's names. Anyway, I sat down to put on my skates. But wait! I could feel a presence watching me. Sizing me up. It felt almost...sensual? My eyes darted back and forth in suspicion as I gracelessly slid onto the ice.

We played a couple rounds; I didn't keep score but I think my team did pretty well. It appeared my sixth grade hockey skills were still with me. I could skate, and I couldn't aim to save my life. Throughout the game I could still feel the presence watching me, biding its time. I skated over to the edge of the ice rink in exhaustion and attempted to sit in the green bench on the rink side. 

I tripped and fell backwards in slow motion, my rear swiftly carried downwards by the force of gravity. The corner of the bench glinted in the fading winter light. The guy with chronic depression who was already sitting down started to crack a smile as everything sped up

and I lost it. 

my anal virginity.

My crack was speared by the bench corner and I fell to the ground with my masculinity in tatters, my pride in shambles, and my ass split asunder. I looked over at the bench in a haze of shock and lust. The laughter followed me back to my dorm as I, awhirl with confused emotions, wrote this account of my park bench pegging in the hopes of passing it to my therapist on Monday. If anyone reading this has had a similar experience…dm me.
